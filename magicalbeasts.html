						The Ministry of Magic classifies them as XXXXX, known wizard killers that are impossible to train or domesticate. 
						The one here represented is an Hungarian Horntail, but there are many species.

					They are attracted to shiny things, which make them wonderful for locating treasure, but this also means that they could wreak havoc if kept (or set loose) indoors.

				<p id="owltext"> Thestral is a breed of winged horses with a skeletal body, face with reptilian features, and wide, leathery wings that resemble a bat's.
					They are very rare, and are considered dangerous by the Ministry of Magic. Thestrals are, undeservedly, known as omens of misfortune and aggression by many wizards because they are visible only to those who have witnessed death at least once or due to their somewhat grim, gaunt and ghostly appearance.

				<h3>Phoenix</h3>
				<p id="owltext">As phoenixes approach their Burning Day they resemble a half-plucked turkey.
							Their eyes become dull, their feathers start to fall out, and it begins to make gagging noises. 
							Then the bird suddenly bursts into flames only to rise from the ashes shortly after. In a number of days, they grow back to full size.
							Thanks to this ability, phoenixes live to an immense age.

				<h3>Swooping Evil</h3>
				<p id="owltext">When it is not flying with its spiked wings, the Swooping Evil shrinks into a green spiny cocoon.
							It can be quite dangerous, as it is an encephalophage — it feeds on people's brains - and its skin has the ability to deflect at least some spells.
							It secretes venom that, when properly diluted, can be used to erase bad memories.

					They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them...<br> 
					Get too near a Dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out of you. 
					If it can, the Dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself... soulless and evil. 
					You will be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life."<br>
